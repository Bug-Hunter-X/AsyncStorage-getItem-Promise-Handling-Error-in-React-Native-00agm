This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to access the value before it has been fully retrieved.  The `getItem` method is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't return the value immediately.  Trying to use the result before the promise resolves will lead to this error. This can manifest in various ways, such as undefined values, unexpected behavior, or crashes.

```javascript
// Incorrect Usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); //This might work as expected
})
console.log(AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey')); //This will print a Promise, not the value
//Correct usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error retrieving data:', error);
});
```
